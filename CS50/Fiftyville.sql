-- Keep a log of any SQL queries you execute as you solve the mystery.
-- All you know is that the theft took place on July 28, 2020 and that it took place on Chamberlin Street.

-- Query 1: Getting the description of the theft:
SELECT description FROM crime_scene_reports WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND street = "Chamberlin Street";

-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse.
-- Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time
-- â€” each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse.

-- Query 2: Getting the interviews
SELECT name, transcript FROM interviews WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28;

-- Ruth | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot
-- and drive away. If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for cars that
-- left the parking lot in that time frame.
Point: Check licence plate around 10:15 am

-- Eugene | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
-- Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse,
-- I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
Point: Check ATM transactions before 10:15 am

-- Raymond | As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
-- In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
-- The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
Point: Check flights leaving on 29 of july earliest on the morning

-- Query 3: By following flight information we might get an idea of the accomplice and destination.
-- Start by finding the id of the Fiftyville airport and the join it with the flights table
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin_airport_id = (SELECT id FROM airports WHERE city = "Fiftyville")
AND year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 29
ORDER by hour
LIMIT 1;

-- With the destination_airport_id we can answer one of our questions: destination
SELECT city FROM airports WHERE id = 4;
London!

-- Query 4: With the id from flights we can use it to find passport_number from passengers table:
SELECT passport_number, seat FROM passengers WHERE flight_id = 36;
